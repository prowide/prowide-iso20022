The usage of this variation is only relevant when the coupon periods are scheduled to end on the last day of the month.

If a coupon period is longer than one year, it is split by repetitively separating full year subperiods counting backwards from the end of the coupon period (a year backwards from 28 Feb being 29 Feb, if it exists). The first of the subperiods starts on the start date of the accrued interest period and thus is possibly shorter than a year. Then the interest computation is operated separately on each subperiod and the intermediate results are summed up.
