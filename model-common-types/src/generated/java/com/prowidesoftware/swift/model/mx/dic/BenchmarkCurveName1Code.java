     * Pfandbriefe security is a collateralised bullet bond backed by either mortgage loans or loans to the public sector. Pfandbriefe differ from traditional asset-backed securities in significant ways. The most important difference is that Pfandbriefe carry no pre-payment risk since they remain on the balance sheet of the issuing institution. Therefore, their spreads over sovereign bonds are attributable to liquidity and credit quality alone. New indices have been created and existing indices have been modified in response to the growing importance of the Pfandbriefe market. The Deutsche Borse has three synthetic indices called REX, JEX, and PEX. The Pfandbriefe curve is used as a reference for credit as well as mortgage market.
