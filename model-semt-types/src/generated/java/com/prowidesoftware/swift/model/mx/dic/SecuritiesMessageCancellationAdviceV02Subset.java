/**
 * Scope
 * An account servicer sends a SecuritiesMessageCancellationAdvice to an account owner to inform of the cancellation of a securities message previously sent by an account servicer.
 * The account servicer/owner relationship may be:
 * - a central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure acting on behalf of their participants
 * - an agent (sub-custodian) acting on behalf of their global custodian customer, or
 * - a custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a broker/dealer.
 * Usage
 * The previously sent message may be:
 * - a securities settlement transaction confirmation
 * - a report (transactions, pending transactions, allegements, accounting and custody securities balance)
 * - an allegement notification (when sent by mistake or because the counterparty cancelled its instruction)
 * - a portfolio transfer notification
 * - an intra-position movement confirmation
 * - a transaction generation notification
 * The previously sent message cannot be a status advice message (any). If a status advice should not have been sent, a new status advice with the correct status should be sent, not a cancellation advice.
 * The message may also be used to:
 * - re-send a message previously sent,
 * - provide a third party with a copy of a message for information,
 * - re-send to a third party a copy of a message for information.
 * using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.
 * ISO 15022 - 20022 Coexistence Subset
 * This message definition is a subset of an ISO 20022 message that was reversed engineered from ISO 15022. A subset is a message definition that is compatible with another definition, but is more restrictive.
 * The ISO 15022 and ISO 20022 standards will coexist for a number of years. Until this coexistence period ends, the usage of certain data types is restricted to ensure interoperability between ISO 15022 and 20022 users. These restrictions, which are described by textual usage rules in the ISO 20022 message, have been made mandatory in this subset. 
 * NOTE: The ISO 20022 message coexistence textual rules have been kept in the subset to explain why specific data types have been restricted. These textual rules are identified as follows: CoexistenceXxxxRule.
