	<h1>Prowide ISO 20022</h1>

	<strong>The Prowide ISO 20022 library implements the foundation classes to manage ISO 20022 (MX) messages in Java</strong>

	<p>The scope of this javadoc is the features distributed in the <b>pw-iso20022-SRUYYYY-version.jar</b></p>

	<p>The Javadoc is not comprehensive. Due to the large number of classes in the library, many have been excluded from
		this Javadoc to reduce the overall generated HTML size. Representative examples of some message categories were kept.</p>

	<p>This library provides a comprehensive parser and model for all ISO 20022 message categories. The API features
		include parsing messages from XML format to Java, serializing Java model objects into the XML format and the
		conversion between ISO messages and JSON.</p>

	<p>The library implements the general ISO 20022 standard. Complementary packages with restricted ISO versions such
		as SIC, SEPA and CBPR+ are provided in the complementary, proprietary (not open source) library Prowide Integrator.</p>

	<p>This library is based on some components from the Prowide Core base library. So in order to use this, you will
		need also the dependency for the pw-swift-core jar.</p>

	<p>MX classes are split in two main packages:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>com.prowidesoftware.swift.mx.model.dic</b>: which contains all dictionary classes, in other words,
			classes representing business entities which are used inside MX messages. Due to the large number of
		    classes in this package, it is excluded from the generated javadoc. This model objects are simple
			POJO implementations for each element within an ISO 20022 messages. The key feature of the generated
			model is that business dictionary elements are <strong>shared across all message types</strong>
			(they are not coupled to any specific namespace).
		</li>
		<li><b>com.prowidesoftware.swift.mx.model</b>: which contains classes that represent MX messages and provides
		the entry point to parse, build or serialize a message.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The sys subpackage includes classes for the MX system messages.</p>

	<h4>Creating MX messages</h4>
	<pre>
	  MxPacs00800108 mx = new MxPacs00800108();
	  // fill objects with setters (there is one setter per available element)
	  String xml = mx.message();
 	</pre>

	<h4>Parsing MX messages</h4>
	<pre>
	  String xml = "..."; // xml here
	  MxPacs00800108 mx = MxPacs00800108.parse(xml);
  	</pre>
