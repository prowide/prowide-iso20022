/**
 * Scope
 * The DeleteReservation message is sent by a member to the transaction administrator.
 * It is used to request a deletion of one or more reservation facilities set by the member and managed by the transaction administrator.
 * Usage
 * The purpose of establishing reservations facilities is to ensure part of the liquidity on the account will be used exclusively for specific cash flow operations.
 * There are five types of reservation facilities:
 * - UrgentPaymentReservation: Amount set aside by a participant to reserve liquidity from its own account, exclusively for executing critical payments called urgent payments.
 * - HighlyUrgentPaymentReservation: Amount set aside by a participant to reserve liquidity from its own account, exclusively for executing highly urgent payments.
 * - CashReservation: Amount set aside by a participant to reserve liquidity from its own account, exclusively for executing cash withdrawals.
 * - NetSSSReservation: Amount set aside by a participant to reserve liquidity from its own account, exclusively for the settlement of the multilateral cash balance stemming from the Net Security Settlement System.
 * - ThresholdForInvestment: Amount above which funds will be destined for investment.
 * The reservation can be effected directly by the member.
 * He has the possibility to:
 * - reset the reserved liquidity to zero
 * - change the reservation amount during the day with immediate effect
 * - input a default reservation amount for the following day(s); valid until a new reservation amount is requested
 * At any time during the operating hours of the system, the member can query the transaction administrator to delete the reservations facilities that the transaction administrator manages for the member.
 * The member can make his request for deletion based on the following elements:
 * - identification of the system
 * - identification of the account
 * - status of the reservation (default and/or current )
 * - type of reservation.
 *
