/**
 * Scope
 * An account owner sends a SecuritiesSettlementTransactionCounterpartyResponse to advise the account servicer that:
 * - the allegement received is either rejected (that is counterparty's transaction is unknown) or accepted (i.e. either the allegement was passed to the client or the transaction is know with or without mismatches)
 * - the modification or cancellation request sent by the counterparty for a matched transaction is affirmed or not. The account servicer will therefore proceed or not with the counterparty's request to modify or cancel the transaction.
 * The account servicer may be a central securities depository or another settlement market infrastructure acting on behalf of their participants
 * The account owner may be:
 * - a central securities depository participant which has an account with a central securities depository or a market infrastructure
 * - an agent (sub-custodian) acting on behalf of their global custodian customer, or
 * - a custodian acting on behalf of an investment management institution or a broker/dealer.
 * 
 * Usage
 * The message may also be used to:
 * - re-send a message sent by the account owner to the account servicer,
 * - provide a third party with a copy of a message being sent by the account owner for information,
 * - re-send to a third party a copy of a message being sent by the account owner for information.
 * using the relevant elements in the Business Application Header.
 * 
 * ISO 15022 - 20022 Coexistence Subset
 * This message definition is a subset of an ISO 20022 message that was reversed engineered from ISO 15022. A subset is a message definition that is compatible with another definition, but is more restrictive.
 * The ISO 15022 and ISO 20022 standards will coexist for a number of years. Until this coexistence period ends, the usage of certain data types is restricted to ensure interoperability between ISO 15022 and 20022 users. These restrictions, which are described by textual usage rules in the ISO 20022 message, have been made mandatory in this subset. 
 * NOTE: The ISO 20022 message coexistence textual rules have been kept in the subset to explain why specific data types have been restricted. These textual rules are identified as follows: CoexistenceXxxxRule.
